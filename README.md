# ImageCLEF 2024 - Ideology and Power Identification in Parliamentary Debates

 Our project focuses on multilingual parliamentary speech analysis, specifically identification and classification of
 the ideology of the speakerâ€™s party and their governing status. A Logistic Regression model (combined with Count Vectorizer) is employed, trained on a dataset comprising of diverse multilingual parliamentary speech. The model achieves an F1-score of 0.59 for ideology classification and
 0.69 for determining governing status. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated in the context of evaluating
 parliamentary speeches from multiple countries.
